The Yamaha Musical Siren|yamaha_siren.png|That's a cool siren. I want one.|It's time to start a new project.|
|PARAGRAPH|In the second world war, air raid sirens had to be build all across the globe to be sounded as a warning of on incomming bombing. Once teh war
due to an end, these air raid sirens sat mostly unused. Some have been moved to museums, some still remain in place, either as a heritage site, or in case
of another war starting. In Japan, however, the Yamaha Music Corporation converted a selection of air raid sirens into what are "Musical Sirens". They sound
cool and I want one.
|PARAGRAPH|These musical sirens were a celebration of the end of the war, playing music from rooftops that could be heard by an entire town. 
[This Playlist]https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB1mqMx6PKGn9rG58okfkaWs975gbkawD[ contains a selection of videos of these Yamaha musical sirens being
played. You can see from all the comments, that there's a concensus that these sirens create an eerie, yet majestic sound. Hiraeth - a nostalgia for a place
we've never been, a sound we've never heard. Of those, some of my favourites are the Debussy's Claire de Lune, the theme from Dvorak's New World Symphony, and
Debussy's Arabasque.
|SUBHEADING|How To Make a Musical Siren|
|PARAGRAPH|[This page]https://www.airraidsirens.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26999[ is full of information about the musical sirens that were made across Japan
and is the main place I was doing my research for this, as is contains blueprints.
|IMAGE|siren_blueprints.jpg
|PARAGRAPH|Most noticably here is a few realisations I made. Firstly, thse are multiple sirens which play different nodes, rather than one siren which can play
many. This will make this project more expensive, but so much easier. Secondly, I believed these were turbines which ran through a reed or nosle to produce noise,
think jet engine blowing into a harmonica, but these are actually a series of cylinder sirens (which once again are a lot easier to build). As a matter of fact,
they're so easy to build that there is a [WikiHow Guide on how to build them]https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Siren[. 
|BREAK|Looking at the blueprints above, each of the sirens has 2 rings around the outside. First is the air holes which allow the siren to actually make a noise,
and the second is a blockage hole which is used to disable a given siren so it doesn't sound. We can move the blockage ring out of the way to sound a given siren,
and we can use another external system to coordinate these movements to play a tune.
|BREAK|These sirens can all be made of wood to start with, and a cone can be created to amplify the noise. I'll create a wooden prototype to begin with, before
considering alternative creation materials for a future version. 3D printing with PLA plastic could work to make a lighter model, but I'm not sure if this will 
be particularly durable. A metal version would be much heavier and more expensive, but much more durable and closer to the real thing.
|PARAGRAPH|A main issue I've come across in my research and design of this project is tuning the sirens. I intended to use a hand/pedal crank to make the sirens
spin, but it's likely this will be infeasible, given that I will need variable speeds between different sirens, and a consistent speed for the main shaft. As seen 
in the blueprints for the generation 2 Yamaha siren below, the individual shafts for the different sirens are a different size, resulting in different rotation
speeds. I could possibly use a system like this for my sirens too, which could possibly allow for me to use a hand crank as I originally intended for the prototype.

|BREAK|By the looks of it, the spacing of the holes also has an impact on the pitch that is played, so I will need to look at the mathematics for this and figure
out if and where I should be making holes in the outer disk to get the right pitches.
|PARAGRAPH|Last thing to consider is actually getting this to play music. Obviously if we've gotten this far, we have a bunch of sirens which all function at
different pitches, all strung together to be turned on or off at once, all with rings to enable or disable specific sirens. Now we just need to arrange the music
for them. Really, we need to consider a handful of songs we want first so we can determine how many sirens we need and what notes we want, but actually aranging
those songs and coding anything required to actually get them playing. I'll likely just make an a python script for raspberry Pi which can activate or deactivate
the required sirens. No matter how much I love those huge hand-cut calliope scores, I really don't need one, and it's not worth creating a system just to
interpret them. Those it's a cool future project to live-convert something analog like that to digital, or make this system completely analog for the fun of it.
|SUBHEADING|Project Plan|
|PARAGRAPH|Part 1: Pyhsical Design
|PARAGRAPH|I've done a bunch of research here and I think I've got a rough idea of what the design I need is, but I'm going to have to do some additional research
into the sizes I need, how I'll get the speeds right, and the likes. There'll be a bunch of maths involved in this, and I'll likely make some proper schematics,
or at least a CAD model, so that I have a proper guide to follow with details on the size of the components and such. 
|PARAGRAPH|Part 2: Construction of a Test Siren|
By creating a test siren, I can confirm that speeds of rotation I require for tuning. If I'm able to figure out the location of holes in the disk for
tuning, I'll likely end up making one test siren of each tuning hole set to see how difficult that would be to make.
|PARAGRAPH|Part 3: Making Chords|
|PARAGRAPH|Before making multiple sirens, I should string them together to all run from a single motor somehow, and attempt to make a couple of chords as a proof
of concept that these will eventually be able to play music.
|PARAGRAPH|Part 4: Making the Music Module|
|PARAGRAPH|After proving that this works to play basic chords and that this will eventually be able to play music, I can hook these up to a servo or switch of some
sort so that the sirens can be enabled/disabled from a program. This will then allow me to create some basic music. Assuming I go with 3 test sirens, I could
at least play Mary had a little lamb.
|PARAGRAPH|Part 5: Construction of Remaining Sirens|
|PARAGRAPH|Once everything has been tested, and I have a working program to play music, I can begin construction of the remaining sirens. While doing this, I'll
also be able to create some scores for more complex pieces, specifically the ones I picked out previously.
|PARAGRAPH|Part 6: Field Testing|
|PARAGRAPH|When everything is made, I can properly field test the sirens. I'll be able to take them to a field somewhere nearby, far enough from my village that
it won't disturb people, and I can attempt to play some music. As part of my testing, I'll wamt to see how far away I can be from the siren while still being
able to hear the music. Here we can also run some experiments on how fast we can play notes without them getting muddied or breaking anything.
