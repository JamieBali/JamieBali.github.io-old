The Yamaha Musical Siren|yamaha_siren.png|That's a cool siren. I want one.|It's time to start a new project.|
|PARAGRAPH|In the second world war, air raid sirens had to be build all across the globe to be sounded as a warning of on incomming bombing. Once teh war
due to an end, these air raid sirens sat mostly unused. Some have been moved to museums, some still remain in place, either as a heritage site, or in case
of another war starting. In Japan, however, the Yamaha Music Corporation converted a selection of air raid sirens into what are "Musical Sirens". They sound
cool and I want one.
|PARAGRAPH|These musical sirens were a celebration of the end of the war, playing music from rooftops that could be heard by an entire town.
